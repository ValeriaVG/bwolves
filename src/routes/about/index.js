      the world.

      We live in a society where be different or think different is seen as an
      issue, when in fact excess normality is the true villain.

      Nowadays its easy to live our lives believing our main goal is to be
      accepted by the majority, and because of that a lot of people are afraid
      to express their opinions, points of view and creativity â€“ And this has
      led to a homogeneous society where most people feel the need to follow the
      norms of fashion, thinking and behavior, restraining their true potential
      to achieve great things, and preventing society as a whole from achieving
      true diversity.
